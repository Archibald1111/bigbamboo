Bets, Symbols, and Payout Table of Big Bamboo
Premium Symbols: Players are greeted by animals depicted in bright and vibrant colors: a blue bird, a green monkey, a brown boar, and, of course, the panda, which is the most valuable symbol. These symbols can multiply your bet ranging from 12x to 150x for a combination of five matching elements.

Wild Symbol: It can appear anywhere on the game board. The value of the Wild symbol is equivalent to the panda symbol. This symbol also serves a replacement function, completing combinations and turning them into wins.

Mystery Bamboo Symbols: These enigmatic symbols frequently appear in groups and transform into a random symbol after each spin. Occasionally, amidst the regular Mystery Bamboo symbols, players might discover Golden Bamboo symbols, activating the eponymous bonus feature.
